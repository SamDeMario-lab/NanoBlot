There are five columns for the RT-PCR plot metadata file, four are the same as 
their northern blot counterparts. The only new column is the viewing_window.
The viewing_window specifies what region the subsets should be trimmed too.
It should be given as the name of one of the lines from 'probes.bed'.

The easiest way to do the viewing window subset is to use bedtools intersect.
Treat the viewing_window bed annotation as A and the bam file as B.
