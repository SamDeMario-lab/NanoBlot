# To Do

## Code

### Add python to dependencies 
python3 is used during HTseq counting

### RTpcr
Works but only with a newer patched version of samtools, for now it works in yeast but not in human NMD data
An additional thought I had, when we are running RT mode, do we want to add a check to ask if the user would like to run in cDNA mode? 

### I want to change the RDS output. I think it should be after the normailization but before the oversampling
I think it should output both. There should be 2 RDS outputs.

## Logistic

## Genes for multimapping test
TDH1
UBI UB4
