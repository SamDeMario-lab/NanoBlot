# To Do

## Code

### Check YML file
MAC
LINUX
WINDOWS

### Add step checking probe specificity
Just before writing the final bam we should check for a multimapped flag.
  Actually I was thinking about this more and we should put it in the R Package and do the check after we read in the samples.

### DESEQ 
Review 3 suggested we use it for replicates. The only reasonable way to do this is to just check if the overall level of a transcript changes. 

### I want to change the RDS output. I think it should be after the normailization but before the oversampling
I think it should output both. There should be 2 RDS outputs.

### Check integrity of user specified regions.  

### Clean GitHub Repo

### README
## Remove dependencies
## Add Function Descriptions
