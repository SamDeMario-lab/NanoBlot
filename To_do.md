# To Do

## Big Projects
### RTPCR
Test RT-PCR with test samples and test sequencing files

## Small Projects 

### Add user_input_files to the gitignore
I'm pretty sure this works for some of the branches already.

## Final steps
### Fix names in R script
I want it to add the negative probe to the plot name if a negative probe is used

### Add dependences to the -H help text

## Write a manuscript + ReadMe
Describe limitations

### Add example datasets I'm gunna do this last so I can use it to test stuff.
ideally they would be small and approximately the same sequencing depth.
I'm regenrating data from WT and rrp6 directRNA sequencing.
