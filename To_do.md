# To Do

## Code

### Check YML file
MAC
LINUX
WINDOWS

### Fix Rsamtools BamFileList()
We have a function called Scanbamfiles() which we should replace with BamFileList()
I think we only have to change 2 functions

### Update yml file with dependencies in R once linked

### Clean GitHub Repo

### Test the checkForMultimapping() function
I want to make sure it behaves as expected

### Update README 
## Remove dependencies
## Add Function Descriptions

## Genes for multimapping test
