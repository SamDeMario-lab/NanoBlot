# To Do

## Code

### RTpcr
Works but only with a newer patched version of samtools, for now it works in yeast but not in human NMD data

### I want to change the RDS output. I think it should be after the normailization but before the oversampling

## Logistic

### Add example datasets I'm gunna do this last so I can use it to test stuff.
ideally they would be small and approximately the same sequencing depth.
I'm regenrating data from WT and rrp6 directRNA sequencing.
