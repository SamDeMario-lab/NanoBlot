# To Do

## Code

### Check YML file

### Add step checking probe specificity
Just before writing the final bam we should check for a multimapped flag. 

### I want to change the RDS output. I think it should be after the normailization but before the oversampling
I think it should output both. There should be 2 RDS outputs.

### Check integrity of user specified regions.  

## Genes for multimapping test
