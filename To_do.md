# To Do

## Code

### RTpcr
So it works half the time with ampliconclip, I created a post on biostars to see if anyone can look into this

### Check how density plots work
I noticed that we are using the same dataset for making the Nanoblot as the density plots (ridge/violin) I don't think we should do this.

## Logistic

### Add example datasets I'm gunna do this last so I can use it to test stuff.
ideally they would be small and approximately the same sequencing depth.
I'm regenrating data from WT and rrp6 directRNA sequencing. 

### Human NMD plots
