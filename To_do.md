# To Do

### Fix Metadata file
The Metadata file has 3 columns the second column was going to specify whether the input files were FAST5 or BAMs but the we descided to make the script require mapped bam files. 

### Change R script to have it write out the data used to generate the plots as an RDS. 
Should be a one line addition. Maybe a small chunk to make a name. The Sam branch has an alternative R script which does this.

### Fix names in R script
I want it to add the negative probe to the plot name if a negative probe is used

## Write a manuscript + ReadMe

Describe limitations

### Add example datasets I'm gunna do this last so I can use it to test stuff.

ideally they would be small and approximately the same sequencing depth.
I'm regenrating data from WT and rrp6 directRNA sequencing.
